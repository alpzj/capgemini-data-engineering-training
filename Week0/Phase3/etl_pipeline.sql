-- PHASE 3: SQL ETL PIPELINE

-- 1. EXTRACT (Load Data)

-- Create temporary views (Spark SQL style)
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW customers
USING csv
OPTIONS (
  path "/samples/customers.csv",
  header "true",
  inferSchema "true"
);

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW sales
USING csv
OPTIONS (
  path "/samples/sales.csv",
  header "true",
  inferSchema "true"
);

-- 2. TRANSFORM – CLEAN DATA

-- Clean sales data
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW sales_clean AS
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND quantity IS NOT NULL
  AND total_amount IS NOT NULL
  AND quantity > 0
  AND total_amount > 0;

-- Clean customers data
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW customers_clean AS
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL;

-- 3. DAILY SALES

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW daily_sales AS
SELECT 
    sale_date,
    SUM(total_amount) AS daily_sales
FROM sales_clean
GROUP BY sale_date;

-- 4. CITY-WISE REVENUE

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW city_revenue AS
SELECT 
    c.city,
    SUM(s.total_amount) AS revenue
FROM sales_clean s
JOIN customers_clean c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.city;

-- 5. REPEAT CUSTOMERS (>2 ORDERS)

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW repeat_customers AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM sales_clean
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- 6. HIGHEST SPENDING CUSTOMER PER CITY

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW top_customers AS
SELECT city, customer_id, total_spent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.city,
        s.customer_id,
        SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_spent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY c.city 
            ORDER BY SUM(s.total_amount) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM sales_clean s
    JOIN customers_clean c
    ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.city, s.customer_id
) t
WHERE rn = 1;

-- 7. FINAL REPORTING TABLE

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW final_report AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.city,
    SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_spend,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM sales_clean s
JOIN customers_clean c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.city;

-- 8. LOAD (SAVE OUTPUT)

-- Save final report as Parquet
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS final_report_table
USING parquet
AS
SELECT * FROM final_report;

-- 9. VERIFY OUTPUTS

SELECT * FROM daily_sales;
SELECT * FROM city_revenue;
SELECT * FROM repeat_customers;
SELECT * FROM top_customers;
SELECT * FROM final_report;
